NOT BY PLANE

An application that let you decide between different transport modes, in particular Planes and Trains.
I use the Amadeus low fare seach API to perform the research.

To run the application:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Mattia46/not-by-plane
$ node server
```

Open your browser and type
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
